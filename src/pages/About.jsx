              <p>I've dedicated the past 15 years to helping students master the LSAT. While I prefer letting my results speak for themselves, my students consistently tell me I should share more about my impact. They're right – my track record includes helping students gain admission to Harvard Law, Yale Law, and other top schools, with success stories spanning from initial scores in the 140s to final scores in the 170s.</p>
